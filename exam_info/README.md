# Operating Systems Lab - Exam - 2019-06-26

**Please read this description carefully.**

## General Information

Talking, chatting, texting or any other form of live 
human to human communication is not allowed and may lead to a negative grade. 
However, you are allowed to use all other offline and online resources such as 
previous homework solutions, manpages, Stackoverflow, etc.

If you directly copy code from one of these sources, please add a **citation**
as a comment before the code fragment. i.e.
```C
// The following code is from my solution to exercise 5.2
or
// Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14888027/mutex-lock-threads
```

If we find the same code in multiple exams 
without citation, we have to assume cheating and you will receive a 5.

Your program **must compile** on the lab PCs and include compilation 
instructions as a comment at the top of the source file. Also, if 
something does not work as expected, provide comments in the source 
code explaining what you think the problem is. It might improve your grade.

You have 1 hour and 45 minutes to complete this exercise.
Hand in your program using **OLAT**.

### General Hints

 * Don't forget you can load a newer version of GCC on the lab PCs using e.g. `module load gcc/7.2.0`.
 * Remember that you can use `valgrind` to check your program for memory leaks.
 * Try to develop your program incrementally, and focus on the core functionality first.
